# Agent Lifecycle

The BAP-578 standard defines a comprehensive, standardized lifecycle for Non-Fungible Agents, ensuring consistent behavior across implementations while supporting both traditional and learning-enabled agents throughout their evolution.

## Creation and Minting

Agents are created through a standardized factory pattern that supports both immediate deployment and future learning capabilities:

### 1. Template Selection and Configuration
Creators choose from standardized agent templates (DeFi, Game, DAO, Lifestyle, Strategic, etc.) or deploy custom logic. Each template supports dual-path architecture:

- **Path 1 (Standard)**: Immediate deployment with static behavior patterns
- **Path 2 (Learning)**: Advanced agents with learning capabilities enabled from creation

### 2. Enhanced Metadata Configuration
The BAP-578 standard extends traditional NFT metadata to include agent-specific fields:

```solidity
struct AgentMetadata {
    string persona;           // Agent personality and role description
    string experience;           // Experience system description and capabilities
    string voiceHash;        // Voice/audio identity hash
    string animationURI;     // Agent avatar/animation
    string vaultURI;         // Off-chain experience vault location
    bytes32 vaultHash;       // Vault content integrity hash
    
    // Learning capabilities (optional)
    bool learningEnabled;    // Whether learning is active
    address learningModule;  // Learning implementation contract
    bytes32 learningTreeRoot; // Merkle root of learning data
    uint256 learningVersion; // Learning data version
}
```

### 3. Secure Minting Process
The AgentFactory contract creates new BAP-578 tokens with comprehensive validation:
- Metadata integrity verification
- Learning module compatibility checks
- Initial state validation
- Security parameter configuration

## Execution and Operation

Agents operate through standardized interfaces that support both basic and advanced capabilities:

### 1. Action Execution Framework
Owners or authorized delegates trigger agent actions through the standardized `executeAction()` method:

```solidity
function executeAction(
    uint256 tokenId,
    string calldata actionName,
    bytes calldata actionData
) external returns (bytes memory result);
```

### 2. Dual-State Management
Agents maintain state through a hybrid approach:

**On-Chain State**: Critical data stored directly on blockchain
- Agent configuration and permissions
- Learning tree roots (for learning agents)
- Action history hashes
- Security parameters

**Off-Chain State**: Rich data stored in secure vaults
- Detailed experience and conversation history
- Learning tree structures and proofs
- Media assets and personality data
- Performance metrics and analytics

### 3. Learning Integration
For learning-enabled agents, the execution framework includes:
- Automatic experience recording
- Merkle proof generation and verification
- Learning rate limiting and validation
- Cross-agent knowledge sharing protocols

## Evolution and Upgrades

The BAP-578 standard supports multiple evolution pathways:

### 1. Logic Upgrades
Agents can evolve their capabilities through controlled logic updates:
- Owner-initiated logic contract changes
- Governance-approved template upgrades
- Backward compatibility preservation
- Migration assistance tools

### 2. Learning Progression
Learning-enabled agents evolve through standardized mechanisms:

**Experience Accumulation**: Agents record interactions and outcomes
```solidity
function recordExperience(
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes32 experienceHash,
    bytes calldata experienceData
) external;
```

**Knowledge Updates**: Periodic learning tree updates with cryptographic proofs
```solidity
function updateLearning(
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes32 newTreeRoot,
    bytes32[] calldata merkleProof
) external;
```

**Milestone Achievements**: Verifiable learning milestones and capabilities
```solidity
function verifyMilestone(
    uint256 tokenId,
    bytes32 milestoneHash,
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) external view returns (bool);
```

### 3. Standard to Learning Migration
Agents created as standard can be upgraded to learning-enabled:

```solidity
function enableLearning(
    uint256 tokenId,
    address learningModule,
    bytes32 initialTreeRoot
) external;
```

This migration path ensures no agent is left behind as the ecosystem evolves.

## Security and Governance

The standard includes comprehensive security mechanisms for all lifecycle stages:

### 1. Multi-Layer Security Framework

**Circuit Breaker System**: Dual-layer pause mechanism
- Agent-level pausing for individual issues
- Protocol-level pausing for systemic threats

**Access Control Matrix**: Granular permissions system
- Owner permissions for configuration and upgrades
- Delegate permissions for routine operations
- Learning permissions for knowledge updates

**Learning Security**: Additional protections for learning agents
- Rate limiting on learning updates (max 100 per day)
- Cryptographic proof requirements for all learning claims
- Bounds checking on learning parameters
- Anti-manipulation safeguards

### 2. Governance Integration
Protocol-level governance manages:
- Standard evolution and improvements
- Security parameter updates
- Learning module certification
- Emergency response procedures

### 3. Privacy and Data Protection
- User data sovereignty through vault ownership
- Selective disclosure of learning insights
- Cross-agent learning with privacy preservation
- Compliance with data protection regulations

## Standardized Lifecycle Events

The BAP-578 standard defines comprehensive events for all lifecycle stages:

### Creation Events
```solidity
event AgentCreated(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed owner, address logic, bool learningEnabled, address learningModule);
event LearningEnabled(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed learningModule);
```

### Operation Events
```solidity
event ActionExecuted(uint256 indexed tokenId, string action, bytes32 resultHash);
event ExperienceRecorded(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 experienceHash);
```

### Evolution Events
```solidity
event LogicUpdated(uint256 indexed tokenId, address oldLogic, address newLogic);
event LearningUpdated(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 previousRoot, bytes32 newTreeRoot, uint256 timestamp);
event MilestoneAchieved(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 milestoneHash);
```

### Security Events
```solidity
event AgentPaused(uint256 indexed tokenId, string reason);
event SecurityBreach(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 incidentHash);
```

## Learning Lifecycle Stages

For learning-enabled agents, the lifecycle includes additional stages:

### 1. Learning Initialization (0-100 interactions)
- Basic pattern recognition
- Initial preference learning
- Baseline behavior establishment

### 2. Adaptation Phase (100-1000 interactions)
- Personality trait development
- User preference optimization
- Skill specialization

### 3. Expertise Development (1000+ interactions)
- Advanced capability development
- Cross-domain knowledge integration
- Predictive behavior modeling

### 4. Mastery and Teaching (Advanced agents)
- Knowledge sharing with other agents
- Mentoring newer agents
- Contributing to ecosystem learning

## Quality Assurance and Compliance

The standardized lifecycle includes quality mechanisms:

### 1. Compliance Verification
- Automated compliance checking during creation
- Periodic compliance audits for active agents
- Remediation procedures for non-compliant agents

### 2. Performance Monitoring
- Standardized performance metrics
- Benchmarking against template baselines
- Performance improvement recommendations

### 3. User Safety
- Content filtering for learning agents
- Behavior bounds enforcement
- User feedback integration

This comprehensive lifecycle framework ensures that all BAP-578 tokens, whether standard or learning-enabled, behave consistently and securely throughout their entire lifespan. It enables ecosystem participants to build tools and services that can interact with any BAP-578 token while supporting the full spectrum of agent capabilities from simple utility to advanced AI companions.

The standardized lifecycle also provides clear upgrade paths, ensuring that the ecosystem can evolve while maintaining backward compatibility and user trust. This foundation enables the development of increasingly sophisticated agent experiences while preserving the security and reliability that users expect from blockchain-based systems.
